I woke up
chilled to the bone
it's because you weren't there to warm my heart

I saw you
in my dreams
and saw that you looked so dead inside

I gave you my hand
but you declined
you said it's ok I'm doing just fine

But I know that you still writhe in pain
There are some things that time will not erase

It's time for us to go our seperate ways
You look so proud with that scar in your heart
